# Find-Movies App
The Find Movies App is a responsive and dynamic web application that allows users to search for movies by title. It fetches real-time movie data from an external movie API using JavaScript and displays results with details like title, poster, release year, genre, and rating. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and requires an API key to access data.
